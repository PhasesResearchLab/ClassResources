# Phases Research Lab Software Projects
This repository serves as a meta-index of all software projects our group members are working on, ranging from small private ones to large and open-source ones, with emphasis placed on the latter.

## Active Development

- üü¢ ‚úÖ [**pycalphad**](https://github.com/pycalphad/pycalphad) - is a free and open-source Python library for designing thermodynamic models, calculating phase diagrams and investigating phase equilibria within the CALPHAD method. It provides routines for reading Thermo-Calc TDB files and for solving the multi-component, multi-phase Gibbs energy minimization problem.

- üü¢ ‚úÖ [**ESPEI**](https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/ESPEI) - **E**xtensible **S**elf-optimizing **P**hase **E**quilibria **I**nfrastructure, is a tool for creating CALPHAD databases and evaluating the uncertanity of CALPHAD models. The purpose of ESPEI is to be both a user tool for fitting state-of-the-art CALPHAD-type models and to be a research platform for developing methods for fitting and uncertainty quantification.

## Contributions

- Please limit the description to 3 lines of text and up to 1 of badges.
- Make sure to include links to source code if the project is open-source.
- If you are an **active PRL member** you should have write access to this repository by default, and you are allowed to make changes directly.
- If you are a **past PRL member**, you are welcome to contribute (1) the code you worked on while active to the appropriate category (please use `Legacy` if you no longer actively maintain it), as well as (2) code you created after leaving the group under `Alumni Work`. You can contribute by forking the repository and opening a pull request.
- The easiest way to contribute is to open GitHub dev environment in your browser by simply clicking `.` key. It will work on any device with a keyboard (even an iPad!). With it, **you can make a simple contribution in under a minute without any knowledge of git!**. Simply (1) edit the text in the README file, which will open automatically, (2) click on the _Source Control_ icon on the left panel (third from top), (3) write a short message about what you did, and (4) click _Commit&Push_. Done!

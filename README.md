## Contributions

- If you are an **active PRL member** you should have write access to this repository by default and you are allowed to make changes directly.
- If you are a **past PRL member**, you are welcome to contribute (1) the code you worked on while active to the appropariate category (please use `Legacy` if you no longer actively maintain it), as well as (2) code you created after leaving the group under `Alumni Work`. You can contribute by forking the repository and opening a pull request.
- The easiest way to contribute is to open GitHub dev environment in your browser by simply clicking `.` key. It will work on any device with keyboard (even an iPad!). With it, **you can make a simple contribution in under a minute without any knowledge of git!**. Simply (1) edit the text in README file which will open automatically, (2) click on the _Source Control_ icon on the left panel (third from top), (3) write a short message of what you did, and (4) click _Commit&Push_. Done!
